# TODO

## Must Do
* [x] Merge "fixes" branch
* [ ] Review/sanity check with Robert
* [x] Akash schematic checklist
* [x] Better DFM check
* [x] Luke schematic checklist
* [x] Akash layout checklist
* [ ] Luke layout checklist
* [x] Upload GRBR and get full quote

## Questions/Tentative

* [ ] Output capacitance from Sawson's filtering (~55 uF) exceeds spec for LP5912... is this a problem?
  * [ ] Check if this violates output cap spec of FPGA supply as well
  * [ ] Can potentially depopulate these when demo time rolls around...
* [ ] Put decoupling caps on each power plane?

## Wishlist

* [ ] Labels on bottom pins (EASY)
* [ ] Options for SPI input available directly on board
* [ ] Header pins to enable pin remapping in case of problem
